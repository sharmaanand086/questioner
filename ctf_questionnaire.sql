Started as a Teacher, was earning only 1000Rs. a month. My only ambition was and is still today to add zeroes to my Income. I hate being at home as there are always people coming to my house. Am in a joint family and my motherinlaw is a pain - she always has her daughters / sisters / brothers coming over and staying at home. Am not a people\'s person infact I dont have friends also. Am happy in silence and cant take noise, commotion extra talking gossiping and bitching about people because am also not perfect. Bottomline is nobody is here to please anyone....so i wake up and just want to get out of  my house because I can then enjoy my space. My business i nurtured from scratch and from zero - my business gave me the power of money - to buy what i want because i cant say NO to myself ever. Am very important to myself - my smile is very important to me. So when am at work am happy. its a getaway from the mess of home, the household chores and  so many times the home staff goes on leave that I just refuse to be a maid at home. I want to lead a good life because i got married very young - too many responsibilities i shouldered at a young age, too many indifferences i managed and coped up with my motherinlaw / my hubby and me are two different individuals and gracefully i have lived all through. When financial crisis stuck, i stopped asking from my hubby anything  and till today even if am dying I will not ask him anything. So my business which I nurtured gives me peace contentment and a module to run out of the mess at home because Indian cultures force you to live and I believe in finding Solutions. So my journey is this and sometimes i feel grateful for this mess as I am What i am today and i really dont care. So i wake up fulfil my responsibilities as a homemaker but allow me to add here along with my home staff because when my cook goes on leave i do nothing....my food comes from out and my motherinlaw who is a fanatic cook manges the kitchen.

My Manager who used to trust and respect me for my work & people skills, approached me to take over the additional responsibility of the process, re-build it and do whatever it takes to save the damage. It was an option given to me and my refusal would not have impacted my job at all as it was not my profile.

All i could understand was that my manager trusted me so much and i must give it a sincere try for him. Everyone else saw me as foolish to agree but i took over, hired people, got them trained, ensure the process is on, clients are managed and slowly though, things came on track. All i invested was to build a team of people who were willing to just do it for me in a way i was committed to do it for my manager.  -	As a result, i discovered my ownself and evolved as a professional, -	Had a team who never left me unless i was in the organization -	And am still known and remembered by the organization as someone who could simply create a structure out of a mess.'),
